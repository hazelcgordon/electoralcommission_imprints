This research is funded by the Leverhulme Trust and led by the Department of Psychology at the University of Sheffield. This project has been approved by the University of Sheffield’s Ethics Review Committee. Before you decide to take part in this study, please read carefully the following information. Please contact us if there is anything that is not clear or if you would like more information.



About This Survey



Our research investigates how individuals perceive content posted online and the regulation of such content. We are looking for general adult internet users based in the UK to answer a survey. You will first be asked to consent to the study. If you decide to take part, you will be shown a series of social media posts and asked several questions about your perception of them. Please note that you will be randomly shown a small number of posts from a larger pool, and many are political in their nature. You will also be asked a number of questions about your demographic information, such as your gender and education level, levels of social media engagement and your political views. It is expected the survey will take between 10 and 15 minutes to complete.



Voluntary Participation



It is your decision whether or not to take part. If you initially consent, you can still withdraw at any time by simply closing your browser. You do not have to give a reason and there will be no negative consequences. If you wish to withdraw your consent after completing the survey, you can email our team (t.stafford@shef.ac.uk) and we will delete your data as requested.



Possible risks of taking part



The social media posts in the survey are similar to the types of content typically seen online, and they are not expected to cause any discomfort. However, if you choose to participate and change your mind when completing the survey, we encourage you to leave the study by simply closing the browser window. We would also like to make it clear that the purpose of the study is not to influence your opinions, but to understand how you make judgments. The information shown to you does not reflect the views of the research team or the University of Sheffield more widely. Additionally, there will be no way for the researchers to identify your individual response and all measures will be taken to ensure anonymity, meaning there is no risk to your privacy after completing the study.



Possible benefits of taking part



If you choose to complete the full survey and answer all attention check questions correctly, then you will be paid for your time. Please note if you exit the study early or fail the attention checks you will not receive this payment. You will also be contributing to scientific understanding of how judgments are made in various social situations, which is valuable information that can be used by other scientists and the general public more widely.



Your Data



You will not be asked to provide any identifying information other than your Prolific Academic ID. Your individual data will be merged with the data from the other participants and stored in a dataset. In any publications, we will only discuss overall trends in the data, rather than discussing information about any individual participant. We will collect no identifiable information so responses will be entirely anonymous. It is intended that the results of the research will be published in an academic journal. If you are interested in a summary of the results once data collection and analysis has been completed, please use the contact information to let the researchers know and they can ensure you are kept up to date with the progress of the study. At the end of the study, this survey data will be made into “Open Data” and stored in an online database for public access.



What is Open Data?



Open data means that data are made available and free of charge to anyone interested in the research, or who wish to conduct their own analysis of the data. Once shared openly, the research team no longer has control over how these data are used. However, as all data are anonymised, it is not possible to identify any personal information and poses no risk to your privacy.



Why Open Data?



Sharing data openly promotes good scientific practice, allowing the validity of conclusions to be checked by other researchers, as well as increasing the impact of the research in the contribution to new knowledge. Establishing open access to research data and findings is considered an optimal scientific practice and is a requirement of many funding bodies and scientific journals. As a large proportion of research is publicly funded, the outcomes of the research are expected to be made publicly available. Sharing data helps to maximise the impact of investment through wider use and encourages new avenues of research.



Contact



If you have any questions then please contact Dr Tom Stafford of our research team by emailing t.stafford@shef.ac.uk. If you would like to raise any concerns about the project then please contact the head of the Department of Psychology, Professor Elizabeth Milne by emailing: e.milne@sheffield.ac.uk

Thank you for taking part in our research, your response is greatly appreciated. We would like to tell you a bit more about the aims of the study. What we did not inform you initially is that all the material would be political in their nature. The reason for not disclosing this was to gauge if the posts could be easily recognised as political campaign material. This survey was an experiment, meaning some participants were shown slightly different variations of the posts to what you saw. The primary purpose of the study was to test whether viewing a ‘digital imprint’ with political campaign material influenced the judgments made about them and increased how informed citizens feel about the source of a campaign. A digital imprint is a disclaimer included somewhere in close proximity to paid political adverts and online posts from registered campaigners to disclose extra information, such as the address of the promotor. This is now legally required by the UK government on certain political advertisements, online and in person.



Half of those who took part in this survey were informed about these new regulatory requirements for campaigners at the beginning of the survey. Each person was then randomly assigned into groups which determined which pieces of campaign material they viewed with a digital imprint. All campaign material viewed was taken from real Facebook pages of existing third-party campaign groups registered in the United Kingdom, but the names of the organisations were changed to fictional ones. This was to reduce the effect of pre-existing opinions about the group influencing how the content was judged.



It is important for you to know the political views you were shown in the posts do not represent the views of the researchers or the University of Sheffield more widely. Although the material may have expressed views you agree or disagree with, it was not intended that the content of the advertisements influence your political beliefs, or express any judgement towards them.



We encourage you to do your own research when deciding which political candidates to support. In the case you’d like to know more about the options available to you when voting in general elections, we have provided a website link below about the political parties whose representatives were successful in elections to the House of Commons at the 2019 General Election. You can right click the link to open it in a new internet tab and return to the tab after submitting your survey response. Please note which parties are available for you to vote for can depend on which country and constituency you live in. In your constituency, there may also be other political parties available for you to vote for outside of those listed. You can find out more information from your local council website about this on the lead up to election time.



More information can be found at the following link: https://members.parliament.uk/parties/Commons



To find out more about legal requirements for political campaigners in the UK, please visit the Electoral Commission website: https://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/



The research team did not intend to show you content any more distressing than what you might see when browsing online, however we recognise viewing the material may have caused discomfort. If you would like, you can use the box below to express any concerns about what you saw or share your experience of the survey more generally. Keep in mind these responses will be anonymous. If you would like to contact the researchers directly, please use the following contact details for Professor Tom Stafford instead: t.stafford@sheffield.ac.uk
